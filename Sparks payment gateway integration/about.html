                    <b>As we can see many people are suffering from cancer today and to those victims proper money is not there to make treatment.
                    So our sparks donation has formed a committe in order to help such victims.Society who are willing to give their helping hands
                    can use our website. Unfortunately, as a whole, our society is unaware of where donations are needed and where their donations
                    are going. The diseases with the most victims receive less donations than diseases that do not kill nearly as many.
                    One of the biggest aspects of the misallocation of donations is the simple fact that donations are being sent to the wrong places.
                    Hence because of this many people are not coming forward to make donations. But our website is secure and you can believe and give your helping hand
                    and help those victims.</b>
